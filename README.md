# flappybirdneuralnet
Designing flappy bird and training it in P5.js


bestbird is the code to run the best bird -  which is loaded from a json file
- this feature is still in the works and I want to make it so that you can load an existing bird into the same canvas
  with the click of a button

userplayable is the code for a human to play flappybird - no design on this version yet
- i want to implement this in the main code to be able to choose to play or train

neural net version - is the version in the main directory 
- you can adjust training speed with the slider and also you can see the high score and all time high score

-next steps would be to add buttons to toggle things like population size, pipe height, width, spacing, etc. make it a user interface 


also i would like to implement this code onto my website
